## Technology

Foodie is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) developed in **.NetCore 3.0** as backend and **Angular 7** as frontend. It uses **MSSQL Server** as DBMS and because PWA needs SSL to actually work, **Nginx** serves as reverse-proxy server using **Let's Encrypt** certificate. All of this contenerized in **Docker**.
